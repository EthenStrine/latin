### Fourth Declension

Although the fourth declension does not have as many words as the first three declensions, it is important to learn it. It has the same cases as the other declensions, and they work in the same ways (nominative is the subject, etc.). The most common vowel in the fourth conjugation is -*u*. There are no fourth declension adjectives. The adjectives from the first, second, and third conjugations are used with the fourth conjugation. Remember that though the endings may not look the same, the adjective must agree with the noun in case, gender, and number. Notice that the adjective follows the correct forms for its declension, and the noun follows the correct forms for its declension; though they may not look the same, they do agree. (See page 12)

### The Demonstratives *hic* and *ille*

A demonstrative pronoun is a pronoun that points out or demonstrates something. These demonstratives can be used as nouns or as adjectives. *Hic* means "this" (the object, person, etc., near the speaker). *Ille* means "that" (the object, person, etc., distant from the speaker). I remember this by observing that both the word *hic* and the word *this* have -*hi* in them; therefore, they go together. Both *hic* and *ille* are irregular in form in the singular, but they do follow a form that is somewhat similar to *qui* and *quis*. In the plural, they decline much like magnus except for the *haec* in nominative and the accusative neuter plural. The best thing to do is memorize them. (See page 13)

### The Demonstrative* is*

*Is* is less emphatic than *hic* or *ille*. It usually refers to someone or something that has just been mentioned. If it is not used with a noun, it works much like a personal pronoun (*he*, *she*, *it*). The declension of *is* is similar to the declensions of *hic* and *ille*. Notice that in the neuter, the nominative and the accusative are exactly the same. Also notice that the plural declines with the same endings as the adjectives in the first and second declension. (See page 14)

### Declension of *mille*

*Mille* is an indeclineable adjective in the singular that means "one thousand." In the plural, however, it declines in all five cases. When *mille* is used as an adjective in the singular, it agrees with the noun in case. If it is used in the plural, the noun to which it is referring will be in the genitive. Any time *mille* is used with *passus*, it means "mile" (one thousand paces). (*Mille passus* is one mile;* tria milia passuum* is three miles). Be very careful in your translation not to mix up *mille* with *miles* (soldier). (See page 14)

## Grammar Rules

### The Demonstrative *Idem*

We have already talked about the use of demonstrative pronouns in Unit 1. There is one more demonstrative to learn - *idem*. It means "the same" and is a compound of the pronoun *is* with a -*dem* attached to the end of it. Observe that it declines just like -*is* with a --*dem* attached to the end, except for in the accusative singular and the genitive plural where the --*m*changes to an -n, probably because it was easier to pronounce eundem than eumdem. (See page 24)

### The Intensive

If something is intense, it makes it stronger. The intensive adjective or pronoun emphasizes whatever it is talking about. The words used as intensives in English are the -*self* words (*himself*, *herself*, *themselves*, etc.) when they are being used to emphasize. In Latin, the word used as the intensive adjective and the intensive pronoun is *ipse*. Notice that *ipse*declines somewhat like the demonstrative pronouns (*hic*, *ille*, *is*, etc.). (See page 25)

## Grammar Rules

### The Fifth Declension

The fifth declension works very much like the other four declension in that it has the same cases (nominative, genitive, dative, etc.). The endings of the fifth declension tend to use the letter -*e* most often. Although there are not many words in the fifth declension, the fifth declension words are important ones (hope, thing, day, etc.). To use an adjective with the fifth declension, make it agree with the noun in case, gender, and number, as you usually do. For example, because *res* is feminine, you would have a *res* *bona*; because *dies* is masculine, you would have a *dies* *bonus*. (See page 34)

### Reflexive Adjectives

The third person reflexive adjective is *suus*, *a*, *um*. If this adjective is used, it is referring back to a third person subject and suggesting that whatever the adjective is modifying belongs to the subject. This works much like the word *own* in English. We don't always use the word *own* in English to make it as clear as the Latin. Therefore, this difference between pronouns provides a nice distinction for understanding. *Suus*, a, *um* is used only in the third person. For first person reflexive adjectives (I hit my head), use *meus*, *a*, *um* in the singular and *noster*, *nostra*, *nostrum* in the plural. For second person reflexive, use *tuus*, *a*, *um* in the singular and *vester*, *vestra*, *vestrum* in the plural. (See pages 34 and 35)

### Active Participles

In English, the present active participle ends in -*ing* (I saw your brother eating an ice cream cone). The present active participle is used to describe or further give information about a noun or a pronoun. It generally represents an act that occurs at the same time as the main verb (at the same time that I saw your brother, he was eating the ice cream cone). To create the present active participle in Latin, take the present stem of the verb and add -*ns*. For example, the present active participle for *amo* is *amans*; the present active participle for *pono* is *ponens.* The present active participle for *audio* is *audiens* (in third -*io* and fourth declension verbs, the -*ie* remains throughout the declension). The present active participle declines like a third declension adjective with the end of the stem being -*nt*. English doesn't actually have a future active participle, but Latin does. The future active participle is translated going to or about to. For example, Marcus, about to carry the bicycle across the finish line, flexed his muscles. To create the future active participle, drop the ending from the perfect passive participle and add -*urus* (*portaturus*, *portatura*, *portaturum*). The future active participle declines like a first or second declension adjective - like *magnus*. (See pages 35 and 36)

## Grammar Rules

### Perfect Active Infinitive

The perfect active infinitive denotes perfect tense and is translated "to have" (to have run, to have fought, to have gone, etc.). To create the perfect active infinitive in Latin, take the third principle part and add --*sse*(*cucurrisse*, *pugnavisse*, *venisse*, etc.). The perfect active infinitive is used to show an action that has happened in the past of the main verb. The saying or the thinking is present, and the seizing or the freeing happened before (in the past of) the present. (See page 44)

### Perfect Passive Infinitive

The perfect passive infinitive is formed by taking the perfect passive participle (the fourth principal part) and *esse* (*portatus esse*, *doctus* *esse*, etc.). The perfect passive infinitive is translated "to have been" (to have been carried, to have been taught, etc.). Because it is formed using the perfect passive participle, the perfect passive participle must agree with the subject of the infinitive in case, gender, and number. Because *Marcus*is the subject of the sentence, *vulneratus* agrees with *Marcus* (nominative masculine singular). Because *puellae* is nominative feminine plural, *doctae*is nominative feminine plural. (See page 45)

### Future Active Infinitive

The future active infinitive is formed by taking the future active participle and *esse* (*portaturus* *esse*, *docturus* *esse*, etc.). If you stop to think about it, you will see the logic (the perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle, and the future active infinitive uses the future active participle). The future active infinitive translates "to be going to." That is a mouthful, but that is how it should be translated. Because it is formed using the future active infinitive, the future active infinitive must agree with the subject of the infinitive in case, gender, and number. (See page 45)

### Indirect Statement (Indirect Discourse)

In English, after verbs of saying, knowing, thinking, hearing, observing, perceiving, etc., we often use the word *that*. By doing this, we indicate that this statement is not directly quoted. If we are making a direct quotation, we use quotation marks to show exactly what the person was saying, thinking, etc. You are already used to creating direct statements. To create an indirect statement in Latin, an infinitive is used in the dependent clause with an accusative subject (yes, this is different from what you are used to). When you have an infinitive with an accusative subject, you will know to translate it as an indirect statement. We call this usage of the language indirect discourse. If you have an infinitive that you don't know what to do with, always check to see whether or not there is an accusative that can work with it in indirect discourse. (See pages 45 and 46)

### Indicative and Infinitive Tenses

The tenses of the indicative (the verbs that you currently conjugate and use in your translations all of the time), are determined by their relationship to the present time. If something is happening right now, the verb is in the present tense. If something will happen tomorrow, the verb is in the future tense. If something happened yesterday, the verb is in the perfect tense. You already know how this works. The tenses of the infinitive, however, are a little bit different. Because the infinitive does not stand alone as a main verb in the sentence, it depends upon the main verb of the independent clause. Therefore, if the infinitive verb is happening at the same time as the main verb, you will use a present tense infinitive (even if the main verb is not present tense). If the infinitive verb is happening in the future of the main verb, then you will use a future tense infinitive. If the infinitive verb is happening in the past of the main verb, then you use a perfect infinitive. The main key to determining which infinitive to use in indirect discourse is to determine whether the event is happening at the same time, in the future of, or in the past of the main verb of the sentence. If this seems a bit fuzzy to you right now, it will become clearer as you practice. (See page 46)

## Grammar Rules

### Comparison of Adjectives

In English, if we have two things we are comparing, we may say that one of them is smaller than the other. If we have three or more things, we will usually say we have one that is *small* (positive), another that is *smaller*(comparative), and a third that is *smallest* (superlative). To do this, we use the comparison of adjectives. We do the same thing in Latin, and, of course, we change the meaning by changing the ending of the word. To create the comparative, you must take the stem and add -*ior*. To create the superlative, you must take the stem and add -*issimus*. Observe that in the comparative and the superlative, the first, second, and third declensions are the same. This is nice since once you get past the positive, they all decline the same. (See page 54)

### Declension of Comparatives

To decline a comparative adjective, use the endings for third declension. The endings are identical to the third declension noun endings. As usual, the neuter looks the same in the nominative and accusative case. Notice also that comparatives do not have the -*i* in the ablative singular or the -*ium* in the genitive plural as third declension adjectives do. The superlative declines like *magnus*, *a*, *um*. (See pages 54 and 55)

### Comparison of Adverbs

The best part about adverbs is that they do not decline. They do, however, compare. For example, we say *easily*,* more easily*, and *most easily*. In Latin, of course, we change the endings. Once you get to the comparative and the superlative, the first, second, and third look the same. Notice that the comparative is the same form as the neuter comparative adjective. Also notice that to create the superlative, you drop the -*us* and add -*e*. Overall, adverbs are very easy. The trick is to recognize them as adverbs without trying to make them into something else. (See page 56)

### Comparative Adjectives and Superlatives

There are two groups of words that form the superlative a little bit differently from what we learned about in Part C. These words are those that have superlative stems ending in -*er* or -*l* (*liber*, *facilis*). Instead of adding the -*issimus* to these superlatives, just add another -*r* or -*l* and add -*imus*. Notice that the positives and the comparatives are the same as the words you learned previously. Only the superlatives are different. (See pages 56 and 57)

### Dative with Special Adjectives

There are some adjectives in English after which we naturally use the word *to* (similar to, unfriendly to, etc.). These words will naturally be followed by the dative case in Latin. Some of these adjectives which you already know are *similis*, *dissimilis*, *amicus*, *inimicus*, *aptus*, and *gratus*. (See page 57)

## Grammar Rules

### Irregular Adjectives

If you have three items in English, and you compare them as to quality, you may say one is *good*, another is *better*, and the third is *best*. Notice that good, better, and best do not even look similar. This is also true with *bad*, *worse*, and *worst* and *much*, *more*, and *most*. These are what we call irregular adjectives because their comparatives and superlatives do not follow the usual patterns. Of course, we have adjectives in Latin that are also irregular. Once you have memorized the comparatives and the superlatives for each adjective, it is easy to decline them because they follow the same rules as the regular adjectives. To create the adverbs for each, you also follow the rules for the regular comparison of adverbs. (See page 64)

### Adjectives Without Three Degrees

There are several adjectives that do not have a positive, and there are a few that do not have a comparative. If you look at *senex*, you will notice that there is not a superlative. I guess the Romans didn't want to tell someone he was the oldest man. Once again, the comparatives and the superlatives of the adjectives decline as the regular ones do, and the adverbs are created as regular adverbs are created. (See page 65)

### Reflexive Pronouns

In English, reflexive pronouns are used to refer back to another noun in the sentence (most often the subject). For example, *myself* would be a reflexive pronoun in the sentence *I hit myself*. The action has a reflex or a reference back to* I*. There are first, second, and third person reflexive pronouns (*myself*, *ourselves*, *yourself*, *yourselves*, and *himself*, *herself*, *itself*, and *themselves*). In Latin, the personal pronouns for the first and second persons (*ego*, *nos*, *tu*, *vos*), can be used as reflexive pronouns. Third person reflexive pronouns, however, are different. The third person reflexive pronoun (and the third person reflexive adjective, which you have already learned) make it possible to make a great distinction between a reference back to the subject or to someone else. (See pages 65 and 66)

## Grammar Rules

### The Subjunctive Mood

There are three moods in both English and Latin: indicative, imperative, and subjunctive. The indicative mood is the one we use in general statements. In Latin, it is the mood that includes all six verb tenses, active and passive, which you have already learned. The imperative, remember, is the mood of commanding or ordering, and it has only a singular and a plural in Latin (*porta*, *portate*). The understood subject of the imperative is you. The subjunctive mood is rarely used in English, and as time goes by, it becomes less and less common. In Latin, the subjunctive is used for a wide variety of purposes. You will learn the usages one at a time, just as you have learned the usages of the ablative case. Of course, there are first, second, and third person active and passive for each tense. The present tense is formed by using an -*e* as the connecting vowel for the first conjugation and an -*a* for the connecting vowel all of the other conjugations. The third -*io* and the fourth conjugations retain the -*i* before the -*a* all the way through. The first person singular has an -*m* after the connecting vowel in the active and an -*r* after the connecting vowel in the passive. In the second person, we use the imperative mood to make a command or an order. In the first and third persons, we use the hortatory (iussive) subjunctive (the names of this subjunctive are often used interchangeably). We translate this subjunctive into English by using the word let. (See pages 74--76)

### The Purpose Clause

In addition to the hortatory (iussive) subjunctive you learned in the last section of this unit, the subjunctive is also used for purpose clauses. In English, we don't use a subjunctive of purpose. Instead, we tend to use infinitives to represent that sense of purpose. For example, we would say, "I ran to catch the bus" (the purpose of the running was to catch the bus). In Latin, these purpose clauses are always subordinate (dependent) clauses. To introduce a clause, you must use a *ut* if it is a positive clause and a *ne* if it is a negative clause. Then, the verb of the purpose clause will be in the subjunctive mood. Remember that the *ut* and the *ne* are indicators of a subjunctive clause. Be sure, however, to look to see whether or not the verb after the indicator is subjunctive. (See page 77)

### The Imperfect Subjunctive

Creating the imperfect tense of the subjunctive is very simple. In every conjugation you take the second principle part of the verb and add the usual endings. The ending for the first person is -*m*. This is also true with the word *sum*. Remember, regardless of the word, you use the second principal part as the stem and add the endings. As you see, once again, it is extremely important to know your principal parts. Be sure to memorize the imperfect subjunctive and be able to conjugate any word in the imperfect subjunctive. (See page 78)

## Grammar Rules

### Result Clauses with *ut* and ut *non*

A result clause is a clause that expresses a result from an action of the main verb in a sentence. The result clause is a dependent (subordinate) clause. The main clause will usually have a word that means "so" or "so much" such as *ita*, *tam*, or *tantus*. The result clause will be introduced with an *ut* if it is a positive clause and an *ut* *non* if it is a negative clause. Note that the result clause is introduced with an *ut*. If it is a negative result clause, it has *ut* *non*. Also note that the sequence of tenses is the same as with the purpose clause. One way to tell whether a clause is a result clause is to check to see whether or not the dependent clause tells a result from the independent clause. I often translate the dependent clause as follows: "with the result that." If it makes sense to use these words to translate the *ut*, then it is most likely a result clause. (See page 87)

### Ablative of Degree of Difference

The ablative of degree of difference comes either with no preposition at all or with the prepositions *post* or *ante*. It also is used with a comparative to show the degree of difference or the measure of difference between two objects or things. Remember, when you are showing degree of difference, you use the ablative case to show the distance or the relationship between two things, objects, people, etc., that are being compared. (See page 88)
