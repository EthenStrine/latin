### Grammar Rules
#### Pluperfect Active Subjunctive
Overall, the subjunctive mood of verbs is really quite easy because they are basically the same for all of the conjugations. The pluperfect active subjunctive is formed by taking the perfect active infinitive (the -isse form) of the verb and adding the endings. Notice that you use the same endings you usually use to denote person (m, s, t, mus, tis, nt). (See 1.2)

#### Time Clauses Using Ubi, Postquam, Cum
Ubi, postquam, and cum are often used in Latin to express a sense of time in the past. If the circumstance of the main verb is dependent upon the cum clause, then you use a subjunctive verb in the cum clause. If the main clause and the cum clause are not directly related except that they happened at the same time, then you use an indicative verb in the cum clause. When you use a subjunctive clause, it will be identified as one of the following kinds of clauses, depending on the meaning of the cum. Remember, the cum subjunctive clause will always be a dependent clause. (See 1.2)

#### Perfect Active and Perfect and Pluperfect Passive Subjunctive
The perfect active subjunctive looks almost identical to the future perfect active indicative. The only difference occurs in the first person singular, which ends in erim rather than in ero. To create the perfect active subjunctive, use the third principal part of the verb and add the endings erim, eris, erit, erimus, eritis, erint. Regardless of the conjugation (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd (io), or 4th) the perfect active subjunctive uses the third principal part. To create the perfect passive subjunctive, use the fourth principal part of the verb and the present subjunctive tense of the verb sum. Be sure to note that regardless of the conjugation, you should use the fourth principal part. The pluperfect passive subjunctive is as easy as the others. Use the fourth principal part of the verb, then add the imperfect subjunctive tense of sum (essem), and conjugate it. Once again, all of the conjugations use the fourth principal part. (See 1.3)

#### Deponent Verbs
Deponent verbs are irregular in that they appear in passive form but actually have active meaning. The way to identify deponent verbs is to look at their principal parts. Notice that the first principal part is the first person singular passive of the present active indicative. The second principal part is the present passive infinitive. There is no third principal part since the third principal part is usually the first person singular perfect active indicative, and there is no active form of deponent verbs. The fourth principal part is the perfect passive participle, as usual. When you conjugate deponent verbs, you only do it in the passive since there are no active forms in the six tenses of these verbs. There are, however, active forms of the infinitives and participles. To translate deponent verbs, just use the meaning of the word and translate it actively. Deponent verbs may seem somewhat confusing, but if you just remember that they are passive in form and active in meaning, you should do well. (See 1.4)

### Grammar Rules  

#### Indirect Questions 
In English, we ask questions all of the time. The Romans also asked a lot of questions. There are, however, two ways to ask a question. The first way is to ask a direct question. A direct question is a question that we conclude with a question mark in English: “Where are we?” and, “What is your name?” The second kind of question is known as an indirect question. The indirect question is contained in a sentence and only implies the question: “I wonder where I put my shoes.” “He told me where he had put it.” Notice that these questions do not end with a question mark. If the question is direct, the Latin verb will be an indicative verb. If the question is indirect, however, the Latin verb will be subjunctive. Indirect questions will be dependent (subordinate) clauses in sentences and will often be introduced with an interrogative verb (saying, knowing, asking, perceiving, thinking, etc.).The verb in the indirect question will follow the same sequence of tenses that you have already learned.Note that if the subjunctive part of the clause happens earlier in time than the indicative clause, you must use a perfect tense subjunctive verb in the primary sequence and a pluperfect tense subjunctive verb in the secondary sequence. (See 2.2)

#### Indefinite Pronouns and Adjectives
In English, our indefinite pronouns are words that refer to things or people in indefinite ways: someone, somebody, anyone, anybody, everyone, everybody, no one, nobody. We also have indefinite pronouns and adjectives in Latin. The word quidam means “a certain one.” Declining quidam as a pronoun is quite easy. It declines very much like qui, quae, quod with the suffix dam added. Note that the only difference between quidam and qui occurs in the accusative singular where the -m changes to an -n. Some believe that the reason for this was an ease of pronunciation. It is much easier to say quendam than it is to say quemdam. To decline quidam as an adjective, decline it the same way as the pronoun, except in the nominative and accusative singular where it is quiddam rather than quoddam. Aliquis is less definite than quidam. It generally means “some” or “any.” Declining aliquis is really quite easy. Note that it declines the same as quis, quid, except in the nominative and accusative plural, in which it is aliqua rather than aliquae. The adjective aliquis is similar to the relative qui, quae, quod. Note that there are only a few differences between the relative qui, quae, quod and the indefinite aliquis. The feminine nominative singular is aliqua (as opposed to quae), and the neuter nominative and accusative are aliqua (as opposed to quae). Otherwise, the declensions are almost identical. Sometimes, aliquis becomes quis, which is even less definite. There is a little rhyme that will help you remember when this occurs. Here is the rhyme: After every si, nisi, num, and ne, every ali falls away. When this occurs, the quis is translated anyone or anything. (See pages 2.3)

###Grammar Rules


#### Future Passive Participle/Gerundive
The future passive participle is often called the gerundive. To create the future passive participle, use the present stem (from the first principal part), and add the endings -ndus, -nda, -ndum (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Once you have the word, it declines like normal in the first and second declension. The future passive participle is often used with a form of the verb sum. When this occurs, it suggests a sense of necessity or obligation. English words like ought, must, should, and have to are often used to translate this sense of necessity. Be sure to remember that because it is a passive participle, it will only be used in a passive voice. Whenever you see a future passive participle with a form of sum, remember that it includes a sense of necessity. (See 3.2)

#### Indirect Commands
A direct command occurs with the imperative mood. For example, “Come here, right now!” An indirect command occurs with words of asking, ordering, commanding, etc. (rogo, peto, quaero, mando, impero, moneo, persuadeo, etc.). When these words are used, the clause that explains what was asked, sought, etc., uses a subjunctive verb. The entire clause acts as the direct object of the main verb in the sentence. For example, “He commanded that the battle be fought.” He commanded what? That the battle be fought. In Latin, the dependent clause (that the battle be fought) uses a subjunctive verb. When these words of asking, ordering, commanding, etc., are used, the person who is asked, ordered, commanded, etc., will be in the dative, the accusative, or the ablative cases. The case that should be used will depend upon the verb being used. (See 3.3)

#### Noun Clauses of Result
Verbs that mean “happen,” “cause,” “affect,” “bring about,” etc., are often followed by ut or ut non and a subjunctive clause. Once again, these subjunctive clauses are acting as direct objects to the main verb and, therefore, are called noun clauses of result (they give us the result of the main verb). For example, “It happened that I crashed my car four years ago.” (This is a true story. It was my dream car—convertible, leather everything, fully loaded. I mourned for it like a friend.) Anyway, “that I crashed my car four years ago,” tells what happened. Therefore, it is acting as a direct object of the verb telling the result. (See 3.3)

#### Gerunds
In English, a gerund is the -ing form of a verb when it is acting as a noun. For example, “Skiing is fun.” In this sentence, skiing is a gerund. In Latin, the nominative form of the gerund is the present active infinitive of the verb (to ski is fun). In the other four cases, the gerund is formed by taking the present stem of the verb and adding the same endings as the masculine singular gerundive. Although they look very much alike, gerunds and gerundives have different functions in sentences. They also have different characteristics. The biggest key to determining whether a word is a gerund or a gerundive is to look to see whether or not it agrees with something else in the sentence. (See 3.4)

### Grammar Rules


#### The Word Fio
As I mentioned in the introduction to this unit, there are many irregular verbs in Latin. These verbs do not exactly follow the rules for conjugation in the five conjugations. They are often regular in many ways, but irregular in the present and sometimes other tenses (as you have already experienced with verbs such as eo). Facio has no passive in the present, imperfect, or future tenses. The present active is somewhat irregular. The imperatives of fio are regular: fi, fite. The word fio acts as the passive of facio in the present, imperfect, and future tenses. Rather than using facio to express “be made” or “become” in these tenses, they used the word fio. Therefore, though it is active in form, it is passive in meaning (basically, it is the opposite of a deponent verb). The verb fio, as well as some other passive forms of verbs (appello, be called; videtur, seem; deligor, be chosen or be selected), are often used with predicate nominatives (nouns that remain in the nominative case). (See 4.2)

#### Volo and Nolo
Volo and nolo are also irregular verbs. They are only irregular in the present indicative and subjunctive. The other tenses are regular. You will notice that there is not a fourth principal part for either verb. The reason for this is that there is no passive of these verbs. The only way to really learn the present tense of volo and nolo is to memorize them. Volo does not have an imperative. The imperative of nolo, however, is often used in conjunction with the present infinitive to form negative commands. (See 4.3)

#### Datives
With some verbs (such as impero, permitto, persuadeo), a dative is used as an indirect personal object (to whom) along with an ut clause as a direct object. The ut clause is in the subjunctive, as usual, and it follows the usual sequence of tenses. The dative case alone can often be used to express a sense of purpose. This is called the dative of purpose. The dative case can also be used to indicate a person who is being referred to or mentioned. This is called the dative of reference. The double dative occurs when both the dative of reference and the dative of purpose are used together. This often, but not always, occurs in sentences using a form of sum. (See 4.4)

###Grammar Rules

#### Datives with Special Verbs
As you may have noticed, some verbs are compounds of other verbs that you already know but with prefixes attached to them. Often, the compounding of the verb changes its meaning a little bit. This verb is often followed by a dative. The English equivalents of these words often call for a to or a for to help the sentence make sense. It is similar in Latin, except that the to or for is understood in the dative case. It is important to know this: if the uncompounded form of the verb is transitive (it takes a direct object), the compounded form can be followed by both a dative and an accusative. (See 5.2)

#### Locative Case
As you have already learned, to express place where in Latin, you use “in + the ablative case (in insula—on the island).” When you are using the names of cities or towns, small islands, domus, or rus, you should use what is known as the locative case. It is easy to remember what the locative case means if you remember that the word locative comes from locus (place). The best way to translate the locative case is to use the words at or in plus the meaning of the word (Romae—at Rome). (See 5.3)

### Grammar Rules
#### Subjunctive with Verbs of Fearing
The subjunctive clause after verbs of fearing are introduced in exactly the opposite way of what you are used to. After verbs of fearing such as timeo and vereor (any verb that suggests fear), there will be a subjunctive clause telling what is being feared. This clause will be introduced by a ne for a positive clause and an ut for a negative clause. The uses of ut and ne here are exactly the opposite of what you use for a purpose clause. Be sure to remember that the ut and the ne mean the opposite of what they usually mean here. I remember this by remembering that people often get confused when they are afraid. So, it is in clauses used after verbs of fearing that the meanings of these words are opposite. In translating and creating these clauses, use the normal sequence of tenses. (See 6.2)

#### Impersonal Verbs
There are some verbs in Latin that appear only in the third person singular. These verbs are translated “it is + ________ (the meaning of the word).” They are almost always followed by an infinitive. Some impersonal verbs take special cases. Licet (it is permitted) takes the dative of the person (to whom it is permitted). Placet (it is pleasing) takes the dative of person (to whom it is pleasing). Oportet (it is necessary) takes the accusative (like indirect discourse—accusative subject and infinitive verb). The trick to these words is recognizing them and remembering that they must be translated “it is ________.” (See 6.3)

#### Genitive of the Whole
The genitive of the whole, sometimes called the partitive genitive, represents the whole to which the part is taken. It is similar to our approach in English. Note that pars is not very specific, but familiae tells us what the whole from which the part is taken. The partitive genitive is often used after words such as nihil, satis, and quis/quid. (See 6.4)

quisque—each  
salubris—wholesome  
suscipio—undertake  


### Grammar Rules 

#### Omission of Sum
Sometimes, sum is left out of the sentence when it is used with a passive form of the verb. It is also often left out  when it is used in a compound sentence when both verbs are a form of sum. There really isn’t much more to say about this except that if you are missing a verb form, you probably should try putting in a form of sum to make the sentence work. (See 7.2)

#### The Relative as a Connective
Sometimes, the relative pronoun or adjective will appear at the beginning of the sentence. When this happens, it is being used to connect this sentence with a preceding sentence. The relative pronoun will refer to something in a preceding sentence. (See 7.3)

#### Place to Which
Sometimes, when we are referring to a place to which someone or something goes, we leave out the preposition ad or in, which usually accompanies the destination. This occurs especially with names of cities or towns and a few other words such as domus. (See 7.4)

#### Quisque and Quisquam
Quisque (each) when used as a pronoun is declined like quis. When used as an adjective, quisque is declined like qui. Quisque is most often placed after a pronoun or a superlative adjective. Quisquam (any, anyone, anything) occurs only in the singular and is declined like quis. The only exception is that quicquam is used in the place of quidquam. (See 7.5)

tego—cover  
timor—fear  
vultus—expression  


### Grammar Rules

#### Ablative of Separation
The idea of separation is expressed by using a preposition (ab, de, or ex) and the ablative case. There are a few words, such as excedo and libero that do not require the preposition before the ablative of separation. The noun (which is being separated from something else) is still in the ablative case, however. (See 8.2)

#### Genitive and Ablative of Description
Both the genitive and the ablative cases can be used to describe. Generally, the genitive and the ablative of description both include an adjective and a noun. Here is a general rule to follow for correct use of these constructions:

The genitive of description is most often used for permanent qualities.

Dux fortitudinis magnae vir est.

(The general is a man of great courage.)

This is considered a permanent quality.

The ablative of description is most often used for temporary qualities.

Dux irae magnae vir est.

(The general is a man of great anger.)

This is considered a temporary quality; perhaps soon he will be a man of great happiness. (See 8.3)

#### Relative Purpose Clauses
Sometimes, a relative pronoun (qui, quae, quod) will be used instead of an ut to introduce a subjunctive purpose clause in a sentence. The relative pronoun in a purpose clause will decline just the same as a relative pronoun regularly declines. For example, the pronoun will agree with its antecedent in case and number, and the case it is in will depend upon its usage in the clause (subject, direct object, etc.). Patres Publium Furianumque Graeciam miserunt qui ruinas viderent. (Their fathers sent Publius and Furianus to Greece so that they might see the ruins.) Notice that the qui is masculine plural because it is agreeing with Publius and Furianus. The qui is in the nominative case because it is the subject of its own clause. (See 8.4)
